           <h2>Epic Mail</h2>
           <p>The internet is increasingly becoming an integral part of lives. 
              The invention of electronic mail by Ray Tomlinson , 
              emails have grown to become the primary medium of exchanging
              information over the internet between two or more people, 
              until the advent of Instant Messaging (IM) Apps.
              As EPIC Andelans who work towards advancing human potential 
              and giving back to the society,we wish to empower others by
              building a web app that helps people exchange 
              messages/information over the internet.</p>
